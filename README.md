# Android Navigation Architecture Component
Demo of ANC. [Can't write that again]
ANC is a part of the Android Jetpack library.  
This component provides new guidelines to structure our application, specially navigation between fragments.  
Remember those awful fragment transactions needed for fragment navigations?  
Thanks to ANC, we don't need to do those.  
And handling all of those can be done in just a few lines of codes.  

Ya. Too much wisdom.  
Now, this demo:  
Launcher shows up with 2 buttons (for now).  
One with Simple Navigation and other with Bottom Navigation.
